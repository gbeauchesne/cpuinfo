Overview
--------

cpuinfo consists in an API/library used by programs to get information
about the underlying CPU. Such information include CPU vendor, model
name, cache hierarchy, and supported features (e.g. CMP, SMT, SIMD).

A sample application "cpuinfo" is also available to demonstrate the
use of the library.


Quick build notes
-----------------

It's generally enough to proceed as follows:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Or, if you prefer from a source package:
$ rpm --rebuild cpuinfo.src.rpm

--prefix=PREFIX             install in PREFIX [/usr]
--libdir=LIBDIR             use LIBDIR for native libraries [/usr/lib64]
--enable-static             build static libraries [no]
--enable-shared             build shared libraries [no]
